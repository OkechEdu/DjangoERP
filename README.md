# DjangoERP

A complete set of ERP tools built with Django Rest Framework and Vue js

Structural Architecture of the Project
- Everything resides in the core directory
- The apps are named by the following convention core/apps/crm, core/apps/common, core/apps/hrm, core/apps/fintech etc
- The frontend code resides in core/frontend and it is separated by app name e.g frontend/crm, frontend/hrm/ etc

High Level Overview of the Backend architecture and the Why?
- I have decided not to go with the ideal MVT architecture of Django.

- Taking inspiration from DDD, I have structured the project into the following :
        domain - where all the domain logic goes.
        
        repo - where all the repository logic goes.
        
        logic - where all the busines logic goes.
        
        handlers - where the usual views and webhooks go.
        
        tests - where the tests go. However, the tests are further broken down by domain/ , repo/, logic/ , handlers/ 
        
- All the Django apps will follow the above structure. This design has been chosen also to separate Infrastructure concerns coupling the code.
